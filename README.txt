* Please use the `altimetrik-db.sql` before running the application.
* To check the API endpoints, I have just added my postman collection `AltiMetrik.postman_collection.json`. You can just import it in your postman application and test the API's.


Note: For now I just printed the errors in `Console` but in my production application I always prefer to use logger service.
